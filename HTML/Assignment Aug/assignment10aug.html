    <h2> 1- Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?</h2>

        <P>HTML tags and HTML elements are related but not the same thing.

            HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages. It consists of various elements that define the different parts and components of a webpage. HTML is made up of a series of tags and text content, which are then interpreted by web browsers to display the web page to users. <br>
            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML documents. An HTML element consists of an opening tag, the content, and a closing tag (in some cases, an element can be self-closing without a closing tag). The opening tag denotes the start of an element, and the closing tag indicates the end of that element. The content between the opening and closing tags is the data that is displayed or affects the behavior of that element.</P>

    <h2> 2- What are tags and attributes in HTML?</h2>

        <p> In HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), tags and attributes are essential components used to define the structure and behavior of web documents. Let's take a closer look at what tags and attributes are: <br>
            Tags:
            HTML tags are the fundamental building blocks of HTML documents. They are used to define the structure and content of a web page. Tags are represented by angled brackets (< and >) and usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag denotes the start of an element, and the closing tag denotes the end of that element. The content between the opening and closing tags is what is displayed or affects the behavior of that element. <br>
            Attributes:
            HTML attributes provide additional information or modify the behavior of HTML elements. They are used within the opening tag of an element and are written as key-value pairs. Attributes are optional for most HTML elements but are crucial for elements that require additional information or customization.</p>

    <h2> 3- What are void elements in HTML? With Example.</h2>

         <p>Void elements, also known as self-closing elements or empty elements, are HTML elements that do not have a closing tag. These elements are used to insert various types of content, but they do not require any content between an opening and closing tag because they don't have any content or text content themselves. <br>
         Void elements are written as single tags, typically ending with a forward slash (/) before the closing angle bracket (>). The presence of a closing slash is a signal to the browser that the element is self-closing and doesn't need a separate closing tag. <br>
         Here are some examples of common void elements in HTML: <br>
           1-  < br > - Line Break Element <br>
           2-  < hr > - Horizontal Rule Element: <br>
           3-  < img > - Image Element: <br>
           4-  < input > - Input Element: <br>
           5-  < meta > - Meta Information Element (used in the < head > section): <br>
           6-  < link > - External Resource Link Element (also used in the < head > section): <br> </p>

    <h2> 4- What are HTML Entities? With Example.</h2>
         <p>HTML entities are special codes used to represent characters that have reserved meanings in HTML. Since HTML uses specific symbols for tags and attributes, certain characters like angle brackets (< and >), ampersand (&), and double quotes (") cannot be directly used in the content of an HTML document without causing confusion or parsing errors. HTML entities provide a way to display or represent these characters correctly in the browser. <br>
            HTML entities start with an ampersand (&) followed by a specific code and end with a semicolon (;). The code represents the character that needs to be displayed. Here are some common HTML entities with their corresponding characters: <br>

           1-  &lt; - Less Than (<) symbol:
           2-  &gt; - Greater Than (>) symbol <br>
           3-  &amp; - Ampersand (&) symbol <br>
           4-  &quot; - Double Quote (") symbol <br>
           5-  &copy; - Copyright (©) symbol <br>
           6-  &reg; - Registered Trademark (®) symbol <br>
            </p>

    <h2> 5- What are different types of lists in HTML? With Example.</h2>
         <p>In HTML, there are three main types of lists you can use to organize and display content: ordered lists (< ol>), unordered lists (< ul>), and definition lists (< dl>). Here's a brief explanation and example of each type:  <br>
         1- Ordered List (< ol>): <br>
            An ordered list is a numbered list where each item is preceded by a sequential number. The numbering starts from 1 by default, but you can customize it using the "start" attribute. <br><br>
         2- Unordered List (< ul>): <br>
            An unordered list is a bulleted list where each item is preceded by a bullet point. This list type is commonly used when the order of the items does not matter   <br> <br>
         3- Definition List (< dl>): <br>
            A definition list consists of terms (dt) and their corresponding descriptions (dd). It is used to display glossaries or other sets of name-value pairs.   <br><br> </p>

    <h2> 6- What is the 'class' attribute in HTML? With Example.</h2>
         <p>In HTML, the 'class' attribute is used to assign one or more class names to an HTML element. It is used to define a class or group to which the element belongs.</p>

    <h2> 7- What is the difference between the 'id' attribute and the 'class' attribute of HTML
        elements? With Example.</h2>
         <p>The 'id' attribute and the 'class' attribute in HTML are both used to uniquely identify elements, but they serve different purposes and have different use cases. <br>

         1. id Attribute:
         The 'id' attribute is used to provide a unique identifier for a single HTML element on a page. It should be unique within the entire HTML document. This means that no two elements should have the same 'id'. <br> <br>

         2. class Attribute:
         The 'class' attribute is used to group and apply styles or functionality to multiple elements. Multiple elements can share the same class, allowing you to apply the same styling or behavior to them. It is a way to categorize and target multiple elements collectively.
         </p>

    <h2> 8- What are the various formatting tags in HTML?</h2>
         <p>In HTML, there are several formatting tags that allow you to control the presentation and appearance of your content. These tags are used to apply various formatting styles to text and other elements. Here are some of the common formatting tags in HTML: <br><br>
               1- Bold Text: < b> or < strong>
                Example: < b>This text is bold< /b> <br>

               2- Italic Text: < i> or < em>
                Example: < i>This text is italicized</i><br>

               3- Underline Text: < u>
                Example: < u>This text is underlined< /u> <br>

               4- Strikethrough Text: < s> or < strike>
                Example: < s>This text is strikethrough< /s> <br>

               5- Superscript Text: < sup>
                Example: E=mc< sup>2< /sup> <br>

               6- Subscript Text: < sub>
                Example: H< sub>2< /sub>O <br></p>

    <h2> 9- How is Cell Padding different from Cell Spacing? With Example.</h2>
         <p>Cell padding and cell spacing are attributes used in HTML tables to control the space between the content inside the table cells and the space between adjacent cells. Let's look at their differences and examples: <br><br>
            1. Cell Padding: <br>
            Cell padding is used to control the space between the content inside a table cell and the cell's boundaries. It allows you to add spacing around the content within each cell. <br>
            2. Cell Spacing: <br>
            Cell spacing is used to control the space between adjacent cells in a table. It sets the distance between the borders of neighboring cells. <br></p>

    <h2> 10- How can we club two or more rows or columns into a single row or column in an HTML
        table? With Example.</h2>
         <p>In HTML, you can use the rowspan attribute to combine multiple rows into a single row, and the colspan attribute to combine multiple columns into a single column within a table. These attributes allow you to create more complex table layouts by spanning cells across rows or columns. Here's an example of how to use rowspan and colspan: <br></p>

         <table border="" width="100%" height="150px">

            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Table Heading</th>
                    <th>Table Heading</th>
                    <th>Table Heading</th>
                    <th>Table Heading</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>

            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <th rowspan="3">Table Data</th>
                    <th colspan="2">Table Data</th>
                    <td>Table Data</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Table Data</td>
                    <td>Table Data</td>
                    <td>Table Data</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Table Data</td>
                    <td>Table Data</td>
                    <td>Table Data</td>
                </tr>

            </tbody>
            <tfoot>
                <tr>
                    <th>Table Footer</th>
                    <th>Table Footer</th>
                    <th>Table Footer</th>
                    <th>Table Footer</th>
                </tr>
            </tfoot>
        </table>

    <h2>11- What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element?</h2>
        <p> BLOCK-LEVEL ELEMENT- Block elements always start from a new line. Block elements cover space from left to right as far as it can go. <br><br>
          INLINE ELEMENT - Inline elements never start from a new line. Inline elements only cover the space as bounded by the tags in the HTML element.</p>

    <h2>12- How to create a Hyperlink in HTML? With Example</h2>
        <p>To make a hyperlink in an HTML page, use the < a> and </ a> tags, which are the tags used to define the links. The < a> tag indicates where the hyperlink starts and the </ a> tag indicates where it ends. Whatever text gets added inside these tags, will work as a hyperlink.</p>
        <label for="Example">Example</label> <a href="https://www.google.co.in/">Clik to open google</a>

    <h2>13- What is the use of an iframe tag? With Example.</h2>
        <p>The iframe in HTML stands for Inline Frame. The ” iframe ” tag defines a rectangular region within the document in which the browser can display a separate document, including scrollbars and borders. An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document. </p>
        <iframe src="../Commands/command of html.html" width="100%" height="100px"> Example</iframe>

    <h2>14- What is the use of a span tag? Explain with example?
    </h2>
    <p>The < span> tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.</p>
    <label for="Example">Example</label>
    <p>course of <span class="Web developing">Web designing</span>, <span class="Web developing">front end</span>, <span class="Web developing">Basics</span> in IT will help to grow up</p>
