    <h2> 1- Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?</h2>

        <P>HTML tags and HTML elements are related but not the same thing.

            HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages. It consists of various elements that define the different parts and components of a webpage. HTML is made up of a series of tags and text content, which are then interpreted by web browsers to display the web page to users. <br>
            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML documents. An HTML element consists of an opening tag, the content, and a closing tag (in some cases, an element can be self-closing without a closing tag). The opening tag denotes the start of an element, and the closing tag indicates the end of that element. The content between the opening and closing tags is the data that is displayed or affects the behavior of that element.</P>

    <h2> 2- What are tags and attributes in HTML?</h2>
     
        <p> In HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), tags and attributes are essential components used to define the structure and behavior of web documents. Let's take a closer look at what tags and attributes are: <br>
            Tags:
            HTML tags are the fundamental building blocks of HTML documents. They are used to define the structure and content of a web page. Tags are represented by angled brackets (< and >) and usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag denotes the start of an element, and the closing tag denotes the end of that element. The content between the opening and closing tags is what is displayed or affects the behavior of that element. <br>
            Attributes:
            HTML attributes provide additional information or modify the behavior of HTML elements. They are used within the opening tag of an element and are written as key-value pairs. Attributes are optional for most HTML elements but are crucial for elements that require additional information or customization.</p>     
    
    <h2> 3- What are void elements in HTML? With Example.</h2>  

         <p>Void elements, also known as self-closing elements or empty elements, are HTML elements that do not have a closing tag. These elements are used to insert various types of content, but they do not require any content between an opening and closing tag because they don't have any content or text content themselves. <br>
         Void elements are written as single tags, typically ending with a forward slash (/) before the closing angle bracket (>). The presence of a closing slash is a signal to the browser that the element is self-closing and doesn't need a separate closing tag. <br>
         Here are some examples of common void elements in HTML: <br>
           1-  < br > - Line Break Element <br>
           2-  < hr > - Horizontal Rule Element: <br>
           3-  < img > - Image Element: <br>
           4-  < input > - Input Element: <br>
           5-  < meta > - Meta Information Element (used in the < head > section): <br>
           6-  < link > - External Resource Link Element (also used in the < head > section): <br> </p>

    <h2> 4- What are HTML Entities? With Example.</h2>  
         <p>HTML entities are special codes used to represent characters that have reserved meanings in HTML. Since HTML uses specific symbols for tags and attributes, certain characters like angle brackets (< and >), ampersand (&), and double quotes (") cannot be directly used in the content of an HTML document without causing confusion or parsing errors. HTML entities provide a way to display or represent these characters correctly in the browser. <br>
            HTML entities start with an ampersand (&) followed by a specific code and end with a semicolon (;). The code represents the character that needs to be displayed. Here are some common HTML entities with their corresponding characters: <br>
            
           1-  &lt; - Less Than (<) symbol:
           2-  &gt; - Greater Than (>) symbol <br>
           3-  &amp; - Ampersand (&) symbol <br>
           4-  &quot; - Double Quote (") symbol <br>
           5-  &copy; - Copyright (©) symbol <br>
           6-  &reg; - Registered Trademark (®) symbol <br>
            </p>  
      
    <h2> 5- What are different types of lists in HTML? With Example.</h2>     
          <p>In HTML, there are several types of lists used to display information in an organized manner. The three main types of lists are: <br>

           1-  Ordered List (< ol >): This type of list is used to create a numbered list, where each item is displayed with a sequential number. <br>
            Example: < ol>

              </p>
